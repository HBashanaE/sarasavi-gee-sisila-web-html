					<p>Situated within the esteemed University of Moratuwa which is globally recognized for its
						unparalleled academic prowess, the Department of Building Economics has consistently
						demonstrated a dedication to excellence. Its rich history, dating back to its inception
						showcases
						the department's pivotal role in shaping the academic landscape of Sri Lanka.
					</p>
					<p>The Department of Building Economics, a beacon of academic excellence and innovation that
						was established in 1983 by the late Professor Siri Caldera, has grown to become a cornerstone of
						the University's commitment to shaping future leaders in construction, economics, and
						management while being the pioneer and sole provider of two government undergraduate
						degrees B.Sc Quantity Surveying and B.Sc Facilities Management.
					</p>
					<p>One of the testaments to our commitment to excellence is the accreditation of the Honours
						Degree of Bachelor of Science in Quantity Surveying. This landmark achievement of being
						acknowledged by prestigious bodies such as IQSSL (Institute of Quantity Surveyors Sri Lanka),
						RICS (Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors), CICES (Chartered Institution of Civil
						Engineering Surveyors) and PAQS (Pacific Association of Quantity Surveyors) reflects the high
						standards and global recognition our program has garnered.
					</p>
					<p>Our alumni who are dispersed worldwide occupy esteemed positions in renowned firms, a
						testament to the quality of education imparted by the Department of Building Economics. The
						department offers a range of postgraduate Masters degrees such as Construction Law and
						Dispute Resolution, Project Management and Occupational Safety & Health Management
						attracting research students who are eager to contribute to the advancement of their respective
						fields.</p>
					<p>Under the visionary leadership of the present Head of Department Dr. Mrs. Anuradha
						Waidyasekara, the department has not only thrived but achieved remarkable milestones. Mrs.
						Anuradha's brilliant leadership, marked by openness, unwavering kindness and nurturing nature
						has guided us through numerous unprecedented achievements.</p>
					<p>Beyond academics, the department recognizes the importance of a holistic education. Initiatives
						such as Sithuwili, Sarasavi Gee Sisila, the classical music extravaganza underscore our
						commitment to balancing the mental health of our students and enhancing their interactive
						skills.
						These endeavors along with other non-academic activities, contribute to a well-rounded
						education that goes beyond textbooks.</p>
					<p>Unarguably, both the degrees B.Sc Quantity Surveying and B.Sc Facilities Management are
						tremendous marks of globally recognized quality, which distinguish its graduates and set them
						apart from the competitive professional landscape. Join us on this journey of academic
						excellence, innovation and global recognition at the Department of Building Economics,
						University of Moratuwa.
